CHANGELOG:



* (0.1.2)
- ! cap-list conf entry: cap at such number of entries and write '... (xyz more)'
- ? (internal) add META-INF folder with classpath entries. AT LEAST CHECK IF NECESSARY !

- (internals) include WAL_SIGN on checks.
- (internals) Add softdepend for WordlGuard, WorldEdit, admittance

***

(0.1.1)
- bugfix: Force WorldGuard to save regions on changes. (Prevents the buyer losing ownership to the seller in case of crashes and other.)

***

(0.1.0)
- add: sign support both for selling and buying.
- add: magic words for signs (not for commands).
- add: '/rlist <region/prefix>' lists all region starting with the specified prefix.
- add: '/rsell *' removes all regions you offered for sale. 
- add: Administrative command /rremove with flexible arguments specifying players, worlds, regions (All, specific, region or world prefixes, multiple arguments for each type).
- add: volume restriction
- add: negative entries for times default along the chain volume->area->buy->transaction(end)
- remove: users-buy, users-sell configuration options.
- add: ignore-permissions configuration option.
- add: bypass permissions for limits including "rbuy.all".
- add: commands per second limit.
- change: default policy is to DENY permissions for everything.
- add: sort displayed regions by name (hopefully everywhere).
- add: configuration entry op-permissions
- note: op-permissions are dependent on the permissions plugin / WorldGuard.
- add: permission nodes for bypasses including "all".
- add: configuration option: list-all-worlds
- change: Unowned regions can not be bought anymore (If offered for sale and the player has the permission 'rbuy.sell-unwoned', the owner will be set to the seller.).
- bugfix: Multiple worlds compatibility: cross world  buying is now impossible, neither for regions with same names nor in general.
- bugfix: The area is now written/read  correctly from transaction entries of the data file.
- bugfix: removing expired transactions is now done correctly on checking a players transactions (little effect if the server reloads plugins daily).
- bugfix: The global region '__global__' can not be sold anymore (should have lead to exceptions anyway...).
- fix: prevent selling the global region.
- internals: adjusted many places to cover null inputs, demand world names to be not null on loading.
- internals: add some javadoc comments.
- internals: add default values as fields (prevents typos).
- internals: Decided upon which methods/attributes to set to public visibility (for the moment).

-------------------------------------------------------------

SCHEDULE:
- !! CLEAN UP THIS LIST , MOVE FROM sCHEDULE / DELETE ENTRIES WHEE APPROPRIATE

- ! COLORS
- ! also forget transactions on save ? (not only on loading).
- ! restricting number of commands per second per player(!)
- ! rhelp text !
- !! MAKE 100% SURE HOW TO SET / CHANGE WG-REGIONS !! grm.preload?
- !  ? only cuboid 
- ? bukkit : default config ?
- ? /rplace to place an offer for someone else (also an anonymous or special acount ?)
- ? /rinfo xyz*
- ? /rlist with options ! (list own, list own|my/other by prefix (!) etc. /rlist own, /rlist X*, /rlist own x*
- ! command based inspection methods for listing area/volume, transactions, whatever for players + manipulation.
- ! flat file strategy -> less space, faster ? separate offers, transactions files, world specific ?
- ! custom language
- ? WorldGuard/worldName: ensure that the functionality is restricted to having the player and regions be in the same world, except for /rsell, probably
- ! op commands for administraction (removing offers, transactions, all/for players, consistency checking etc., create backups..... (? for some: use with * before region name to avoid hundreds of commands ?)
- ! ingame configuration changes 
- ? sorted regions: sort offers.keySet!, keep sorted list in memory, till change.
- ? sector/segmentation sorting for offers
- ! check worldguard selections for finding regions quickly !!!
- ! (new)  auctions !
- ? double comparison - use some other equality that '==', like abs <= min(0.0001, price1/1000, price2/1000 )
- ? more distinct information about limits ( you have xy area left within x days?)
- ? rinfo wand, sign with rinfo
- ? opt: sorted lists for strings (cache!) set null on changes, resort on demand.
- ? opt: saving strategy ? -> multiple files (per world or at least transactions, regions).)
- ? WEPIF directly?

MAYBE:
- ? region specific config update settings (for distances for instance, with passthrough regions ...)
- ? config permissions
- ? multiple owners (all have to agree upon selling)
- ? more fine grained permissions (ops)
- ! TODO: More checks when tas are expired (lazy but more frequent).
- ! TODO: check if lowercase is really used in important places !
- ? sell to a certain person only
- ! log message for buying ?
- ! security settings to avoid tooo long intervals (force setting lower),
- ? logging to database, reading from there on demand.
- ? fastest nearby checking: some segmentation thingy ?
