CHANGELOG:

(0.1.0)
- add: sign support both for selling and buying.
- add: magic words for signs (not for commands).
- remove: users-buy, users-sell configuration options.
- add: ignore-permissions configuration option.
- add: bypass permissions for limits including "rbuy.all".
- add: commands per seconds limit.
- change: default policy is to DENY permissions for everything.
- add: sort displayed regions by name (everywhere).
- add: configuration entry oppermissions
- add: permission nodes for bypasses including "all".
- bugfix: Multiple worlds compatibility: cross world  buying is now impossible, neither for regions with same names nor in general.
- note: op-permissions are dependent on the permissions plugin / WorldGuard.
- internals: adjusted many places to cover null inputs, demand world names to be not null on loading.
- internals: add some javadoc comments.
- internals: add default values as fields (prevents typos).


- ? bukkit : default config ?
- ! check all to/from-config for old left overs.
- ? /rplace to place an offer for someone else (also an anonymous or special acount ?)
- ! /rsell *
- ! /rinfo xyz*
- ! /rlist with options ! (list own, list own|my/other by prefix (!) etc. /rlist own, /rlist X*, /rlist own x*
- ! test selling unowned reghions with sign
- ! list: WORLD-SPECIFIC, in fact: all internals world specific !	
- ! ensure correct region id on signs and texts.
- ! restricting number of commands per second per player(!)
- ! volumen re)striction
- ! new TEST list, LIST about settings and permissions: c,d, dv,u, LIST about all permissions c
- ! op permissions flag to disable op bypasses, permission nodes for rest
- ? WEPIF directly?
- ! config flags for use bukkit-perms, worldguard/WEPIF-perms
- ! area limitation does not work?
- ! add volumen restriction.
- ! rhelp text !
- ! add all configuration variables
- ? opt: sorted lists for strings (cache!) set null on changes, resort on demand.
- ? opt: saving strategy ? -> multiple files (per world or at least transactions, regions).)
- ! all config options
- ! all permissions
- ! administrative commands for removing offers of others rremove all <player>, rremove <region>

(0.0.0)

TESTS (0.0.0):
- money transfer, ownership ransfer
- maxBuy  
- (maxArea=0)
- commands
- multiple owners
- offer placed, add owner, buy 
- member + owner
- member only
- buy own region
- op sells region without owners/members
- non op sells region without owner / member
- maxOffers 
- test nearby from all sides (appr.)
- permissions (fake+Pex)

SCHEDULE:

- ! flat file strategy -> less space, faster ? separate offers, transactions files, world specific ?
- ! custom language
- ! more testing
- ? WorldGuard/worldName: ensure that the functionality is restricted to having the player and regions be in the same world, except for /rsell, probably
- ! op commands for administraction (removing offers, transactions, all/for players, consistency checking etc., create backups..... (? for some: use with * before region name to avoid hundreds of commands ?)
- ! ingame configuration changes 
- ? sorted regions: sort offers.keySet!, keep sorted list in memory, till change.
- ? sector/segmentation sorting for offers
- ! check worldguard selections for finding regions quickly !!!
- ! (new)  auctions !
- ? double comparison - use some other equality that '==', like abs <= min(0.0001, price1/1000, price2/1000 )

MAYBE:
- ? region specific config update settings (for distances for instance, with passthrough regions ...)
- ? config permissions
- ? multiple owners (all have to agree upon selling)
- ? more fine grained permissions (ops)
- ! TODO: More checks when tas are expired (lazy but more frequent).
- ! TODO: check if lowercase is really used in important places !
- ? sell to a certain person only
- ! log message for buying ?
- ! security settings to avoid tooo long intervals (force setting lower),
- ? logging to database, reading from there on demand.
- ? fastest nearby checking: some segmentation thingy ?
