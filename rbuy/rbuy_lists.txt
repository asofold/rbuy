------------------------------
NOTES:

- permissions:
	rbuy.buy
	rbuy.sell
	rbuy.reload

	rbuy.disable
- permissions added in  0.1.0:
	rbuy.max-buy

	rbuy.distance-sell
	rbuy.max-area
	rbuy.sell-unowned
	rbuy.show-own
	rbuy.all
	
- configuration: ...
	If using permissions (used via WorldGuard), set usersSell and usersBuy both to false!
		Ops keep their priviledges. The info commands can be used anyway.	
	
CHANGELOG:

(0.0.1)
- 
- ! change: default policy is to DENY permissions for everything.

SCHEDULE:
- ! conf opts for display worldname, limit list to world of player, sim.
- ! change permission policy to deny for most
- ! sign support (+enabling/disabling individual commands)
- ! op permissions flag to disable op bypasses, permission nodes for rest
- ! area limitation does not work
- ! add volumen restriction.
- ! more testing
- ! add permissions and flag support for bypasses, and for resource intense stuff like listing. 
- ? WorldGuard/worldName: ensure that the functionality is restricted to having the player and regions be in the same world, except for /rsell, probably
- ! op commands for administraction (removing offers, transactions, all/for players, consistency checking etc., create backups..... (? for some: use with * before region name to avoid hundreds of commands ?)
- ! ingame configuration changes 
- ! configurable: show worldname, showWorldspecific
- ? sorted regions: sort offers.keySet!, keep sorted list in memory, till change.


MAYBE:
- ? config permissions
- ? multiple owners (all have to agree upon selling)
- ? more fine grained permissions (ops)
- ! TODO: More checks when tas are expired (lazy but more frequent).
- ! TODO: check if lowercase is really used in important places !
- ? sell to a certain person only
- ! log message for buying ?
- ! security settings to avoid tooo long intervals (force setting lower),
- ? logging to database, reading from there on demand.
- ? fastest nearby checking: some segmentation thingy ?
